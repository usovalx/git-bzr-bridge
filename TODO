- Speed up large exports:
  - custom multi-threaded and properly cached output stream?
  - use native gzip/zlib instead of go implementation?
  - another faster compression libs (lzo?)

- Alternative -- don't save exported data at all
  Just pipe it between bzr fast-export and git-fast-import directly
  or use an in-memory buffer of a few megs
